// Structures is almost same as class. It is defined using keyword struct such as " struct vector " .
/* The structures are value type whereas classes are reference type that stores address.
ex:- vector Myvector= new vector(1,2,3);
vector Myvector2;
Myvector2= Myvector // Makes a copy of each field.
*/
// Strutures are cannot be used for inheritance.
// we cannot assign values to fields in strucutes.
// Structures is well suited for less amount of data (if we want to use few fields such as 5 or less then it is well suited ) and must not contain inheritance.
